### WWL Tenants - Terms of Use
If you are being provided with a tenant as a part of an instructor-led training delivery, please note that the tenant is made available for the purpose of supporting the hands-on labs in the instructor-led training. 
Tenants should not be shared or used for purposes outside of hands-on labs. The tenant used in this course is a trial tenant and cannot be used or accessed after the class is over and are not eligible for extension. 
Tenants must not be converted to a paid subscription. Tenants obtained as a part of this course remain the property of Microsoft Corporation and we reserve the right to obtain access and repossess at any time. 


## Step 1: Power Apps License 

1.  Now that you have a working Office 365 tenant, we will add a Power Platform trial license to the tenant. Open a new tab and navigate to `https://powerapps.microsoft.com/free/`.

2.  On this page, select the **Start using apps** button. Enter the email provided by the lab host. Check the box to agree to the terms and select **Start your free trial.**

3.  Enter the password provided by the lab host and select **Sign in.** If prompted, enter a phone number and select **Submit**. (It is recommended to keep the location set to United States, and enter `0123456789` for phone number.) 

4.  Select **Get Started**. You will be taken to the Power Apps homepage. Select **Skip** if prompted with the tutorial. 


## Step 2: Power BI Trial  

1.  You will also need a Microsoft Fabric and Power BI trial to create dashboards showing the information from Customer Insights. To get started, open a new tab and navigate to `https://aka.ms/trybi` 

2.  You will be prompted to use your M365 admin credential. Select **Continue** to confirm and follow the same steps from the previous task to add the Power BI trial.

3.  Select **Get Started**. It may take a few minutes for Power BI to set up. 


## Step 3: Dynamics 365 Customer Insights trial

Now that we have users with licenses in our Office 365 tenant, we can create our demo Dynamics environments. 

1.  In a new browser tab, navigate to `https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics-365-free-trial` 

2.  Navigate to **Dynamics 365 Customer Insights** in the **Customer data platform** section and select **Try for free**. Enter your provided admin email and select **Start your free trial**. You will then be prompted to enter your country and phone number. Select **Submit**. 

3.  You will then be prompted to enter your country and phone number. Enter '0123456789' for Phone Number. Select **Submit**. 

4.  On the welcome screen, select **Start Customer Insights - Data**. The Customer Insights - Data application will launch in a new screen. You now have both a Customer Insights - Journeys and a Customer Insights - Data trial environment.

5.  Select **Start trial** from the notification banner
